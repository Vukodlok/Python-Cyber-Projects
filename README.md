Scripts for automating common cybersecurity tasks

I am currently working my way through some TCM Security courses and adding the scripts I create through the courses to this repository.

- ssh login brute force; modify the code for given known username, target IP, and password list
- sha256 password crack; provide hash as a parameter in CLI
- web login form brute force; modify the code for target IP, list of usernames, password list text file, and login message
