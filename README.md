# Python-Cyber-Projects
Scripts for automating common cybersecurity tasks

I workied my way through some TCM Security courses and added the scripts I created through the courses to this repository.

- ssh login brute force; modify the code for given known username, target IP, and password list
- sha256 password crack; provide hash as a parameter in CLI
- web login form brute force; modify the code for target IP, list of usernames, password list text file, and login message
- SQL injection script; modify the code for target IP and known login message; provide user when run (0, 1, 2, ...)
- restricted SQL injection; modify the code for target IP and known login message; provide user when run (0, 1, 2, ...)
